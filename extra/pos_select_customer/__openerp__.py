===========================================================

Functionality:
--------------
    * Allow user to set a customer to a pos order in front end views;

Possible improvements and fix:
------------------------------
    * This module displays all the customers. That can be long to display
      if there are a lot of customers in database; Display only 80 could be a
      solution;
    * Images of customers are loaded each time; Similar behaviour as
      products image management (with cache) could be developped;

NON Covered features:
---------------------
    * Possibility to create customers in front end views;
    * Possibility to change price if customer has a list price different as
      the default list price; (Big stuff);
    * Possibility to see if the partner has not the default price list;

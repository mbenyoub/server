Identify when a task could be duplicated
========================================

In task model we add 2 action to control when a task could have any task
similar

-First:

When you create the task and adds name you have a button that will search task
name or description similars to the name set in the new task and you can select
the task that you think that could be the same task  

-Second:

We add the action menu in task model, where you can search task, with some
specific words that could match with other task, to avoid create a duplicated
task
